		/// <summary> Collect this node and its child nodes into a list, provided the node

		/// <p>This mechanism allows powerful filtering code to be written very
		/// easily, without bothering about collection of embedded tags separately.
		/// e.g. when we try to get all the links on a page, it is not possible to
		/// get it at the top-level, as many tags (like form tags), can contain
		/// links embedded in them. We could get the links out by checking if the
		/// current node is a <see cref="CompositeTag"></see>, and going
		/// through its children. So this method provides a convenient way to do
		/// this.</p>
		/// <p>Using collectInto(), programs get a lot shorter. Now, the code to
		/// extract all links from a page would look like:
		/// <pre>
		/// NodeList list = new NodeList ();
		/// NodeFilter filter = new TagNameFilter ("A");
		/// for (NodeIterator e = parser.elements (); e.hasMoreNodes ();)
		/// e.nextNode ().collectInto (list, filter);
		/// </pre>
		/// Thus, <code>list</code> will hold all the link nodes, irrespective of how
		/// deep the links are embedded.</p>
		/// <p>Another way to accomplish the same objective is:
		/// <pre>
		/// NodeList list = new NodeList ();
		/// NodeFilter filter = new TagClassFilter (LinkTag.class);
		/// for (NodeIterator e = parser.elements (); e.hasMoreNodes ();)
		/// e.nextNode ().collectInto (list, filter);

		/// registered for more than one node name, e.g. &lt;LINK&gt; tags too.

		/// <blockquote>
		/// <pre>
		/// x.clone() != x</pre></blockquote>
		/// will be true, and that the expression:
		/// <blockquote>
		/// <pre>
		/// x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()</pre></blockquote>
		/// will be <tt>true</tt>, but these are not absolute requirements.
		/// While it is typically the case that:
		/// <blockquote>
		/// <pre>
		/// x.clone().equals(x)</pre></blockquote>
		/// will be <tt>true</tt>, this is not an absolute requirement.
		/// <p>
		/// By convention, the returned object should be obtained by calling
		/// <tt>super.clone</tt>.  If a class and all of its superclasses (except
		/// <tt>Object</tt>) obey this convention, it will be the case that
		/// <tt>x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()</tt>.
		/// <p>
		/// By convention, the object returned by this method should be independent
		/// of this object (which is being cloned).  To achieve this independence,
		/// it may be necessary to modify one or more fields of the object returned
		/// by <tt>super.clone</tt> before returning it.  Typically, this means
		/// copying any mutable objects that comprise the internal "deep structure"
		/// of the object being cloned and replacing the references to these
		/// objects with references to the copies.  If a class contains only
		/// primitive fields or references to immutable objects, then it is usually
		/// the case that no fields in the object returned by <tt>super.clone</tt>
		/// need to be modified.
		/// <p>
		/// The method <tt>clone</tt> for class <tt>Object</tt> performs a
		/// specific cloning operation. First, if the class of this object does
		/// not implement the interface <tt>Cloneable</tt>, then a
		/// <tt>CloneNotSupportedException</tt> is thrown. Note that all arrays
		/// are considered to implement the interface <tt>Cloneable</tt>.
		/// Otherwise, this method creates a new instance of the class of this
		/// object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of
		/// the corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; the
		/// contents of the fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this method
		/// performs a "shallow copy" of this object, not a "deep copy" operation.
		/// <p>
		/// The class <tt>Object</tt> does not itself implement the interface
		/// <tt>Cloneable</tt>, so calling the <tt>clone</tt> method on an object
		/// whose class is <tt>Object</tt> will result in throwing an
		/// exception at run time.
